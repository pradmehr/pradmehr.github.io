I'm a data enthusiastic who enjoy coding and try to excel at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations. I like working with R and SAS, but I Love Python!

I graduated with a master degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Shiraz University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz_University). Back home, I worked for two years as a Mechanical Engineer in a company where I routinely prepared and submitted reports to address the anomalies by collecting, manipulating, and extracting data. This period proved that I have a sense of enjoyment in analyzing data to convert into functional information.

After coming to the U.S., I had the chance to be admitted in a highly ranked management school ([JSOM](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/)) at [UTD](https://www.utdallas.edu/) to persue my education in Business Analytics program. It broadens my horizon into the field of Data Science and gives me the chance to sharpen my technical skills.
